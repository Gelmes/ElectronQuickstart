# Electrom Quickstart
This is a template that I used to start any personal and private projects. It uses materialize as the styling.

# How to use
Simply add new code in the `js` directory and add its location into `index.html`. I sometimes reuse the code for apps and doing things this way allows me to port app easaly to cordova. This is probably not the best way to do it but it the way that I know.
